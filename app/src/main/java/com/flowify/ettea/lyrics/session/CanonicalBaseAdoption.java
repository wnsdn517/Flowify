 * Decides what a freshly fetched document means for the session's canonical base.

 * <p>Source identity is the canonical digest, not the fetch that produced it. The same source
 * arriving twice (cache preview then network confirmation) is not a replacement and must not
 * invalidate a single derived artifact. A genuinely different source increments the source
 * revision, which is the only axis that invalidates artifacts tied to the old digest.
 *
 * <p>Which source renders is the catalog seat's decision, never this class's; this only says what
 * a seat change means for derived artifacts.
