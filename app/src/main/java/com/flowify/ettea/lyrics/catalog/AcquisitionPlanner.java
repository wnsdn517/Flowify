/**
 * Decides whether a track visit asks any provider, and which ones. Pure: the stored catalog
 * state, the policy, and the clock are the only inputs, so a revisit makes the same decision
 * offline, after a restart, and in any callback order.
 *
 * <p>Rules:
 * <ul>
     *   <li>A manual pin is final. A complete Auto seat still checks newly enabled sources.</li>
 *   <li>With no seat, or a static/incomplete one, only sources whose stored outcome is due are
 *       asked. The retry horizon per outcome lives in {@link #dueAtMs} and nowhere else.</li>
 *   <li>Spotify native is local and free, so it is eligible once per visit regardless of state.</li>
 *   <li>Explicit picker checks bypass this planner entirely: the owner asked for that source.</li>
 * </ul>
