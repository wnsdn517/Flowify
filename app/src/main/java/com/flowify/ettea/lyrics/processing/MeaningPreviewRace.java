/**
 * Settlement-order rules for the Google preview race, as a plain synchronized object.
 *
 * <p>Two independent children work under one parent run: a Google display job on the lane
 * executor and a raw-lyrics AI job on the AI executor. This object owns which outcome may reach
 * the screen, so the lane stays free of order bookkeeping. The contract, mechanically:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Google first, then AI — Google publishes once as preliminary, AI replaces it.</li>
 *   <li>AI success first — late Google is ignored and can never regress the display.</li>
 *   <li>AI failure first — completion waits for Google, then publishes its fallback if usable.</li>
 *   <li>Google success then AI failure — Google remains visible; the failure still travels with
 *       the completion for review/diagnostics.</li>
 *   <li>Google failure never blocks AI: no preliminary is offered and the AI outcome decides.</li>
 *   <li>Both fail — nothing replaces the baseline; the completion reports the AI failure.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Retirement (track/config changes) is deliberately not modeled here. Late publications are
 * rejected by the run guard at post time; cancellation of in-flight work belongs to the lane and
 * its provider tag.
