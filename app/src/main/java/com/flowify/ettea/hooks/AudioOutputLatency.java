/**
 * How far the sound being heard trails the position Spotify reports.
 *
 * <p>Spotify's own player renders through a Java AudioTrack owned by
 * {@code com.spotify.playbacknative.AudioDriver} (a JNI class, so its name and members survive
 * obfuscation). The native core derives the playback position from that track's playback head -
 * the frames the mixer has taken - which runs ahead of what leaves the speaker by the output
 * path's own latency: the mixer and HAL buffers (around 100 ms on a deep-buffer output) and, on
 * Bluetooth, the codec and the headset (another 150-300 ms). AudioTrack#getTimestamp reports
 * the frame actually being presented, so the gap between the two is that latency, measured live
 * for whatever output is in use. Nothing is hooked: the driver is read from its static session map.
